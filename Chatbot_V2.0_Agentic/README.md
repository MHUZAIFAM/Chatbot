\# Agentic News Dataset Chatbot



An \*\*Agentic AI-powered chatbot\*\* that allows users to interact with a structured news dataset through natural language.



The system combines:



\* deterministic data analysis

\* conversational memory

\* LLM reasoning

\* structured dataset retrieval



to answer analytical questions about news articles, rankings, sections, and placement explanations.



The chatbot supports queries such as:



\* Which section an item belongs to

\* Why an item was not selected

\* Highest/lowest ranked items

\* Ranked vs unranked items

\* Dataset statistics

\* Section analytics

\* Follow-up conversational questions



\---



\# Agentic Architecture



The system follows a modular \*\*agent-based architecture\*\*:



```

│

├── DataRetriever

│   Retrieves relevant dataset rows

│

├── AnswerGenerator

│   Uses Gemini LLM for reasoning

│

└── ConversationMemory

&#x20;   Stores previous interactions

```



This architecture allows the chatbot to combine:



\* rule-based reasoning

\* structured data querying

\* LLM-powered explanations

\# Key Features



\## Dataset Exploration



Users can query dataset structure:



\* Total number of items

\* Number of sections

\* Items per section

\* Unselected items



Example:



```

How many items are in the dataset?

What sections exist in the dataset?

How many items are in each section?

```



\---



\## Section Analysis



The chatbot can analyze dataset sections:



```

List all items in Calvary Coverage

How many ranked items are in this section?

What were the unranked items in this section?

```



\---



\## Ranking Analysis



The system supports ranking queries:



```

Highest ranked item in each section

Lowest ranked item in the dataset

List ranked items in a section

```



\---



\## Item Placement



Users can inspect where an article was placed.



Example:



```

Where was item 1167981127 placed?

```



Output:



```

Item 1167981127 was placed in the 'Calvary Coverage' section.

```



\---



\## Selection Explanations



The chatbot can explain \*\*why an item was not selected\*\* in sections.



Example:



```

Why was item 1167634477 unselected?

```



The system reads dataset \*\*\_reason columns\*\* and explains exclusion reasons.



\---



\## Conversational Memory



The chatbot understands follow-up queries:



```

List all items in Calvary Coverage

How many ranked items in this section?

What were those items?

```



The memory system resolves references like:



\* this section

\* those items

\* why



\---



\# Requirements



Python \*\*3.10+\*\* recommended.



Install dependencies:



```

pip install fastapi uvicorn streamlit pandas python-dotenv google-generativeai

```



\---



\# Environment Setup



Create a `.env` file:



```

GEMINI\_API\_KEY=your\_api\_key\_here

```



This key is used by the chatbot for LLM reasoning and explanations.



\---



\# Running the Application



Open \*\*two terminals\*\*.



\### Terminal 1 — Start FastAPI



```

uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8001

```



\### Terminal 2 — Start Streamlit UI



```

streamlit run src/ui.py

```



\---



\# Accessing the Application



\### Streamlit Chat Interface



```

http://localhost:8501

```



Interactive chatbot interface.



\---



\### FastAPI Documentation



```

http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs

```



API endpoint testing via Swagger.



\---



\### Memory Endpoint



```

http://127.0.0.1:8001/memory

```



Displays the chatbot conversation memory.
